foodieFetch is a simple food recipe app built with Vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. It uses the MealDB API to fetch recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand.

## How it works 🍜

When you first open foodieFetch at [foodie-fetch.netlify.app](https://fodie-fetch.netlify.app), you'll see a search bar where you can enter the ingredients you have. Clicking on the "Search" button will fetch recipe results from the API based on your search query.

You'll see a list of recipe results, each with a thumbnail image, recipe name, and a "`Recipe Details 🍲`" button. Clicking on the "Get Recipe" button for a recipe will display a popup with instructions and a video to watch below the instructions.
